summary: Configurable webserver for snap
description: >
  Built with Ubuntu Core in mind.
  NodeSnapWeb (nsw) allows you to start a node.js file with HTTP support (and maybe more in the future).
  It may even allow you to run a headless server.
  Use the --port and --path options when using the start subcommand,
  and --file when using the run subcommand.
